            I was born and raised in Bellevue, Washington. I went to the University of Washington and graduated with a BA degree in Biochemistry but at the time I was burnt out on studying and working in my field so I started working in the logistics industry. After a few years, I felt I needed a career change as well as realizing there were many aspects in my daily operation that could be automated and wanted to create something that could achieve that so I decided to enroll in the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp through the University of Washington to jump into the world of coding.
